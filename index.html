<!--  1. The UI contains a "Search" text input and a "Search" button. When the user clicks the button, 
  only books with either an author, title, or topic that matches the user's query should remain visible on the page. 
  This is done using filter.
        I can see here that you created the inputs, search button and almost had it implemented in BookShelf Class. I made
        some notes in there to help and am available to assist more if you want. -SLL
    2. The UI contains a "Sort by" drop-down menu that contains the following options. There should also be a way to toggle whether the sort is ascending or descending. This is done using sort.
Sort alphabetically (A-Z) by title or author.
Sort by the number of topics.
        Same as the note above, the html looks great and you were so close on the functionality! - SLL
